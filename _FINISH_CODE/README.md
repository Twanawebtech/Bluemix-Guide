# Deploying a Node.js app on to Bluemix

This guide will help you build a useful and fully functional To-Do web app from scratch. You will start by building an app that runs locally and then learn to deploy it to Bluemix. As you progress through the guide, you will add a Cloudant database and the Watson service to the To-Do app

There are three parts to this guide:

**[STEP 1 DEPLOY NODE STARTER APP](https://github.com/Twanawebtech/Bluemix-Guide-Node/tree/master/STEP1-NODE-STARTER)**

**[STEP 2 ADD DATABASE TO YOUR APP](https://github.com/Twanawebtech/Bluemix-Guide-Node/tree/master/STEP2-DATABASE)**

**[STEP 3 ADD WATSON TO YOUR APP](https://github.com/Twanawebtech/Bluemix-Guide-Node/tree/master/STEP3-WATSON)**
