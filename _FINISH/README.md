# Bluemix Guide NodeJS

This guide will help you build a useful and fully functional To-Do web app from scratch. You will start by building an app that runs locally and then learn to deploy it to Bluemix. As you progress through the guide, you will add a Cloudant database and the Watson Text To Speech service to the To-Do app

Here is the link to the working app that you will be building as part of this guide: [Bluemix-Guide-NodeJS][https://bluemix-guide-nodejs.mybluemix.net]
